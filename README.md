Implementation of tab-based navigation with infinite scrolling of pictures using Unsplash API

I have used core Javascript for implementation of tab-based navigation for displaying different collection of pictures in both tabs. 
Infinite scrolling has also been implemented by javascript using the scroll property of window.
